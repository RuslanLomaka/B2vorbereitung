# German B2 TELC Practice App

## Overview
This project started from a practical need: preparing for the German TELC B2 exam.
Instead of using generic tools, I built a lightweight, focused practice app tailored to
the areas I personally needed the most.

The project was developed with the help of AI, which was used as an assistant to design,
refine, and expand features based on real learning needs.

## Purpose
The main goals of this project are:
- targeted B2-level German practice
- measurable progress over time
- zero backend complexity

## Technology Stack
- HTML (structure)
- JavaScript (logic)
- CSS (styling)
- GitHub Pages (hosting)

No backend or server is required.

## Architecture
This is a fully client-side application:
- runs directly in the browser
- hosted on GitHub Pages
- no database, no API, no authentication

Progress and user data are stored locally using LocalStorage.

## Features
- interactive practice exercises
- progress tracking over time
- local persistence of results and attempts
- ability to compare current performance with previous attempts

Tip: Ask the bot/agent to analyze the existing features, suggest improvements, or
identify gaps relevant for TELC B2 preparation.

## Data and Persistence
- all data is saved locally in the browser
- achievements and results persist across sessions
- users can track improvement without accounts or servers

## Motivation
This project reflects a learning-by-building approach:
- solve a real problem (TELC B2 preparation)
- keep the structure simple and maintainable
- focus on effectiveness rather than complexity

## Hosting
The project is hosted via GitHub Pages, making it easy to access, share, and iterate on.

## Future Ideas (Optional)
- more exercise types
- better statistics visualization
- export/import progress
- mobile UX improvements
